## Pedantic Model 
The pattern you’re seeing in FastAPI documentation with Pydantic models is a common practice to separate concerns and maintain clarity in API design. Let me explain the structure and the specific concept of `orm_mode`.

### Structure of Pydantic Models in FastAPI

1. **`UserBase`**:
   - This is a base model that contains shared fields across different variants of the `User` model.
   - Example:
     ```python
     class UserBase(BaseModel):
         email: str
     ```
   - **Purpose**: To define common attributes shared across various forms of the `User` model, reducing redundancy.

2. **`UserCreate`**:
   - Inherits from `UserBase`, adding fields necessary for user creation, like `password`.
   - Example:
     ```python
     class UserCreate(UserBase):
         password: str
     ```
   - **Purpose**: To be used when a new user is created, so it includes fields like `password` that aren’t necessarily returned when reading a user’s information.

3. **`User`**:
   - Also inherits from `UserBase` but represents the full data structure returned from the API, including fields like `id`, `is_active`, and related `items`.
   - Example:
     ```python
     class User(UserBase):
         id: int
         is_active: bool
         items: list[Item] = []

         class Config:
             orm_mode = True
     ```
   - **Purpose**: To represent the full user data returned in API responses, including fields that are stored in the database.

### What is `orm_mode`?

- **`orm_mode`** is a configuration setting in Pydantic models that allows models to work seamlessly with ORMs (Object-Relational Mappers) like SQLAlchemy.
- **Purpose**:
  - When `orm_mode` is enabled, Pydantic models can read data from ORM objects (e.g., SQLAlchemy models) and convert them into the Pydantic model structure.
  - This means you can directly pass SQLAlchemy model instances to Pydantic model constructors and have Pydantic automatically extract and validate the data.

### How `orm_mode` Works:

- Without `orm_mode` enabled, Pydantic models expect dictionaries, not ORM instances.
- With `orm_mode` enabled, Pydantic can read attributes from an ORM model instance as if it were a dictionary.

### Example Usage:

Let’s say you have a SQLAlchemy `User` model instance:

```python
db_user = UserModel(id=1, email="user@example.com", is_active=True)
```

You can then create a Pydantic `User` model from this SQLAlchemy instance like this:

```python
pydantic_user = User.from_orm(db_user)
```

Here, `from_orm` uses `orm_mode` to automatically map fields from the SQLAlchemy model to the Pydantic model.

### Why Use `orm_mode`?

- **Integration with ORMs**: It simplifies the conversion between database models and Pydantic models, which is particularly useful in FastAPI for returning database models as API responses.
- **Readability and Maintainability**: Keeps the API’s data representation consistent with the database schema, making it easier to manage and understand.

### Summary

- **`orm_mode = True`** allows Pydantic models to interact smoothly with ORM models, making it possible to convert ORM instances directly into Pydantic model instances.
- **Model Structure**: Using a base model like `UserBase` allows shared attributes to be reused, while `UserCreate` is specialized for input (like creating a user) and `User` for output (like returning user data in a response).

This structure is both efficient and clear, aligning well with the separation of concerns in API design.



## ASYNC and GIL 
> in my case that I'm creating users crud to the database is it good to add async in my api routes?  will it not block or be a problem for other request, some say there is a problem in GIL 


Yes, adding `async` to your API routes, especially for a CRUD application interacting with a database, is generally a good practice. It can improve the performance of your application by allowing other requests to be handled while waiting for I/O operations, such as database queries, to complete.

### **Why Use `async` for CRUD Operations?**

1. **Non-blocking I/O**: 
   - Database operations are typically I/O-bound, meaning they spend time waiting for data to be read or written. Using `async` in your CRUD operations allows the server to handle other incoming requests during this waiting period, making your application more responsive and scalable.

2. **Concurrency**: 
   - When your application is handling multiple requests simultaneously, using `async` ensures that one long-running request (e.g., a complex database query) doesn't block others. This improves throughput and reduces latency under load.

### **Concerns with the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL)**

The Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) is a mutex that protects access to Python objects, preventing multiple native threads from executing Python bytecodes at once. This can be a concern for CPU-bound tasks that require intensive computation, as it can limit the performance of multi-threaded applications.

**For I/O-bound tasks (like database operations), the GIL is less of a concern**:

- **Async I/O**: When you're performing I/O-bound tasks asynchronously, the GIL isn't as restrictive because the operations are waiting for external events (like data from a database) rather than using CPU time. This allows other tasks to be executed in the meantime.

- **Database Libraries**: Many modern database libraries, such as `asyncpg` for PostgreSQL, are designed to work well with asynchronous frameworks like FastAPI, bypassing many of the issues related to the GIL by offloading tasks to asynchronous I/O operations.

### **When `async` Might Not Be Necessary**

- **CPU-bound tasks**: If your CRUD operations involve heavy computation or processing within Python itself (e.g., complex data transformations), `async` might not be beneficial because the GIL can become a bottleneck. For CPU-bound tasks, you might consider other techniques, such as multiprocessing or offloading the work to background workers.

- **Simplicity**: If your application is simple and doesn't need to handle a high volume of concurrent requests, using `async` might add unnecessary complexity.

### **Best Practice**

For typical CRUD operations involving database interactions, adding `async` to your API routes is usually beneficial and aligns with FastAPI's design:

- **Use `async` for database interactions** to take advantage of non-blocking I/O.
- **Ensure your database library** supports asynchronous operations (e.g., `asyncpg` for PostgreSQL, `aiomysql` for MySQL).
- **Monitor performance**: If you notice performance issues, it might be related to how the async operations are managed or the specific use case (e.g., too many concurrent connections to the database). 

In summary, for a CRUD application that interacts with a database, using `async def` in your API routes is generally a good approach and will likely improve your application's performance and scalability. The GIL is not a significant issue for these I/O-bound tasks.

> use async database interactions: 

## ASYNC OPERATIONS

To determine if your FastAPI code and the database interaction are using non-blocking I/O, we need to review a few key aspects:

1. **FastAPI and Async Support**: FastAPI supports asynchronous programming and non-blocking I/O, but this only applies if the endpoints and the database interactions are implemented in an asynchronous manner.

2. **SQLAlchemy with MySQL**: SQLAlchemy is traditionally blocking and does not natively support asynchronous interactions with the database. However, there is support for asynchronous programming when combined with `asyncpg` (for PostgreSQL) or when using `SQLAlchemy 1.4` with `async` capabilities. Since you're using MySQL, you could leverage `asyncmy` or `aiomysql` with `SQLAlchemy` for asynchronous interactions.

3. **Current Code Review**: The provided code uses SQLAlchemy in a traditional, synchronous way (`create_engine`, `sessionmaker`, and typical ORM queries). This means that your database calls are blocking, and if you want non-blocking behavior, you would need to refactor the code to use asynchronous session handling and async-compatible MySQL drivers.

### Current Implementation and Blocking I/O

- **Database Session**: You're using `create_engine` and `sessionmaker` from SQLAlchemy for database interactions, which are synchronous. This means that when your code executes a database query, it will block the execution thread until the query completes. This behavior can cause performance bottlenecks, especially under heavy load or when database queries are slow.

- **Asynchronous Programming in FastAPI**: FastAPI supports async functions, and they are recommended for I/O-bound operations, such as database interactions. Since your current implementation does not use async/await for database operations, these operations are blocking.

### Moving to Non-Blocking I/O with FastAPI and SQLAlchemy

To convert your codebase to use non-blocking I/O with asynchronous database interactions, you would need to:

1. **Use an Async-compatible Database Driver**: For MySQL, you can use `aiomysql` or `asyncmy`.

2. **Configure SQLAlchemy for Async Usage**: Use SQLAlchemy's async session capabilities introduced in version 1.4.

3. **Refactor the Code**: Change the database interaction code to use async sessions and async functions. This would mean refactoring the `get_db` function, the service functions, and the route handlers to use `async def` and `await`.

### Example of Asynchronous Setup with FastAPI and SQLAlchemy for MySQL

Here’s how you might refactor your current setup to be asynchronous:

#### 1. Update Dependencies

Make sure you have the necessary async libraries installed:

```bash
pip install asyncmy sqlalchemy[asyncio] fastapi uvicorn
```

#### 2. Asynchronous Database Session

Refactor your `database/session.py` to use async sessions:

```python
from sqlalchemy.ext.asyncio import AsyncSession, create_async_engine
from sqlalchemy.ext.declarative import declarative_base
from sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker
from urllib.parse import quote_plus
import os

DATABASE_USER = os.getenv("MYSQL_DEV_USER", "root")
DATABASE_PASSWORD = os.getenv("MYSQL_DEV_PASSWORD", "")
DATABASE_HOST = os.getenv("DATABASE_HOST", "localhost")
DATABASE_PORT = os.getenv("DATABASE_PORT", "3306")
DATABASE_NAME = os.getenv("DATABASE_NAME", "genesis")
encoded_password = quote_plus(DATABASE_PASSWORD)  # if password has special characters

# Use asyncmy for MySQL async support
SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URL = f"mysql+asyncmy://{DATABASE_USER}:{encoded_password}@{DATABASE_HOST}:{DATABASE_PORT}/{DATABASE_NAME}"

engine = create_async_engine(SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URL, echo=True)
SessionLocal = sessionmaker(autocommit=False, autoflush=False, bind=engine, class_=AsyncSession)

Base = declarative_base()

async def get_db():
    async with SessionLocal() as session:
        yield session
```

#### 3. Asynchronous CRUD Operations

Refactor your `database/user_db_interface.py` to use async methods:

```python
from sqlalchemy.ext.asyncio import AsyncSession
from sqlalchemy.future import select
from app.models.user_db_model import User
from app.models.user_api_model import UserCreate, UserUpdate
from sqlalchemy import update, delete

async def create_user_db(db: AsyncSession, user_create: UserCreate) -> User:
    db_user = User(**user_create.dict())
    db.add(db_user)
    await db.commit()
    await db.refresh(db_user)
    return db_user

async def get_all_users_db(db: AsyncSession):
    result = await db.execute(select(User))
    return result.scalars().all()

async def get_user_by_id_db(db: AsyncSession, user_id: str):
    result = await db.execute(select(User).filter(User.id == user_id))
    return result.scalar()

# Similar refactoring for update and delete functions
```

#### 4. Asynchronous Route Handlers

Make sure your route handlers call these async functions and use `async def` and `await` appropriately:

```python
from fastapi import APIRouter, Depends, HTTPException
from sqlalchemy.ext.asyncio import AsyncSession
from app.database.session import get_db
from app.services.user_service import create_user_service, get_all_users_service

router = APIRouter()

@router.post("/", response_model=User)
async def create_user(user_create: UserCreate, db: AsyncSession = Depends(get_db)):
    return await create_user_service(db, user_create)

@router.get("/", response_model=List[User])
async def read_users(skip: int = 0, limit: int = 10, db: AsyncSession = Depends(get_db)):
    users = await get_all_users_service(db)
    return users[skip: skip + limit]
```

### Conclusion

- The original implementation uses synchronous database calls, which are blocking. For non-blocking I/O, you need to use asynchronous drivers and sessions.
- With the above changes, you can leverage FastAPI’s full potential for handling asynchronous operations, which will improve scalability and responsiveness, especially under high loads.
- Ensure that the entire stack, including routes, services, and database interactions, are consistently using asynchronous code to avoid blocking. 

This conversion allows you to handle more concurrent requests efficiently, making your FastAPI application truly async and non-blocking.

### UPLOAD ASYNC

Creating an API endpoint for uploading images or files to Google Drive, saving the information to a MySQL table, and then returning the URL string is a common requirement for many applications. Let's evaluate whether it should be asynchronous or synchronous:

### 1. Nature of the Task

- **Uploading to Google Drive**: This is an I/O-bound task, as it involves sending data over the network to Google Drive. I/O-bound tasks are typically good candidates for asynchronous processing, as they spend most of their time waiting for external systems (e.g., network responses), which allows other tasks to run concurrently.
  
- **Saving to MySQL**: Inserting a record into a MySQL database is another I/O-bound operation. As with uploading, this operation can benefit from being asynchronous to avoid blocking the main thread.

### 2. Not CPU-Intensive

- Neither uploading a file nor inserting a record into a database is CPU-intensive. These operations don't involve heavy computation but instead rely on waiting for I/O operations (e.g., network communication with Google Drive, writing to disk for MySQL). Thus, these tasks are well-suited for asynchronous programming.

### 3. Why Asynchronous is a Good Fit

- **Scalability**: Using async for such tasks allows the server to handle multiple uploads simultaneously. While one upload is waiting for Google Drive to respond, the server can process other requests, making the service more scalable.

- **Responsiveness**: Asynchronous endpoints can respond to multiple requests without being blocked by ongoing I/O operations. This is crucial for user experience, as it minimizes the perceived waiting time.

### 4. When to Consider Synchronous

- If the application requires a strict sequence of operations or has constraints that prevent handling concurrent operations efficiently, a synchronous approach might be simpler to manage.
  
- If the infrastructure or library ecosystem does not fully support asynchronous operations, forcing async could introduce complexity. Fortunately, both FastAPI and supporting libraries for Google Drive and MySQL support async.

### Recommended Approach

Given the nature of the operations (I/O-bound and not CPU-intensive), an asynchronous approach is appropriate. Below is an example of how you might implement this with FastAPI using async functions:

### Example Implementation in FastAPI

1. **Install Required Libraries**: Ensure you have the required libraries installed. For interacting with Google Drive asynchronously, you can use `aiofiles` for file handling and `gdrive-api-wrapper` for Google Drive API. For MySQL, you can use `aiomysql` or `databases`.

   ```bash
   pip install fastapi uvicorn google-auth google-auth-oauthlib google-auth-httplib2 google-api-python-client aiofiles aiomysql
   ```

2. **FastAPI Endpoint for Uploading Image**

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, UploadFile, File, Depends, HTTPException
from fastapi.responses import JSONResponse
from sqlalchemy.ext.asyncio import AsyncSession
from googleapiclient.discovery import build
from googleapiclient.http import MediaFileUpload
from app.database.session import get_async_db
import os

app = FastAPI()

# Function to upload a file to Google Drive
async def upload_to_google_drive(file_path: str) -> str:
    # Use OAuth2 credentials or API key to authenticate
    # Set up the Drive v3 API
    creds = ...  # Load your credentials
    service = build('drive', 'v3', credentials=creds)

    # Create a MediaFileUpload object for the file
    file_metadata = {
        'name': os.path.basename(file_path),
        'mimeType': 'image/jpeg'
    }
    media = MediaFileUpload(file_path, mimetype='image/jpeg')
    
    # Upload the file to Google Drive
    file = service.files().create(body=file_metadata, media_body=media, fields='id').execute()
    
    # Get the URL for the uploaded file
    file_url = f"https://drive.google.com/uc?id={file['id']}&export=view"
    return file_url

# Example route to upload image and save to MySQL
@app.post("/upload/")
async def upload_image(file: UploadFile = File(...), db: AsyncSession = Depends(get_async_db)):
    try:
        # Save the uploaded file to a temporary location
        temp_file_path = f"/tmp/{file.filename}"
        async with aiofiles.open(temp_file_path, 'wb') as out_file:
            content = await file.read()
            await out_file.write(content)

        # Upload the file to Google Drive
        file_url = await upload_to_google_drive(temp_file_path)
        
        # Save the file information to MySQL
        query = "INSERT INTO uploads (filename, url) VALUES (:filename, :url)"
        values = {"filename": file.filename, "url": file_url}
        await db.execute(query, values)
        await db.commit()

        # Return the URL of the uploaded file
        return JSONResponse(content={"url": file_url})
    except Exception as e:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=500, detail=str(e))

# Run the FastAPI server
if __name__ == "__main__":
    import uvicorn
    uvicorn.run(app, host="0.0.0.0", port=8000)
```

### Key Points in the Example

- **Async Functions**: The `upload_image` function and the `upload_to_google_drive` function are asynchronous, allowing them to handle other tasks while waiting for the I/O operations (like file upload and database commit) to complete.

- **Asynchronous File Handling**: Using `aiofiles` to handle file reading and writing asynchronously.

- **Database Interaction**: Using an asynchronous session with MySQL to insert records non-blockingly.

### Conclusion

- **Async is suitable** for your use case because it involves I/O-bound tasks (uploading files and interacting with a database) and can help improve scalability and responsiveness.

- **Maintainability**: Ensure your asynchronous code is readable and maintainable, as it can become complex with error handling, retries, and resource management.

By following these practices, you'll be leveraging FastAPI's capabilities effectively for building scalable and responsive APIs in your eCommerce application.


## IAM MANAGEMENT

To design an IAM (Identity and Access Management) manager that can be reused and modified across different projects (e.g., ecommerce and art auction systems), it's essential to implement a flexible and scalable role-based access control (RBAC) system. Below, I'll outline a data structure and pattern that can be adapted for both scenarios.

### Key Components for IAM Manager

1. **Users**: The base entity for authentication.
2. **Profiles**: Stores additional user information.
3. **Roles**: Defines different types of access permissions.
4. **Permissions**: Specific actions that can be taken within the system.
5. **Role-Permissions**: Association between roles and permissions, defining what each role can do.
6. **User-Roles**: Association between users and roles, defining what role each user has.

### Data Structures

#### 1. **User Table**
Already defined, stores the basic information of users.

```python
class User(Base):
    __tablename__ = "users"

    id = Column(CHAR(36), primary_key=True, default=lambda: str(uuid4()))
    username = Column(SqlString(100), unique=True, nullable=False)
    email = Column(SqlString(255), unique=True, nullable=False)
    password = Column(Text, nullable=False)
    created_at = Column(DateTime, default=func.now())
    last_modified = Column(DateTime, onupdate=func.now(), default=func.now())
    disabled = Column(Boolean, nullable=False, default=False)

    profile = relationship("Profile", uselist=False, back_populates="user")
    user_roles = relationship("UserRole", back_populates="user")

    def __repr__(self):
        return f"<User(id={self.id}, username={self.username}, email={self.email})>"
```

#### 2. **Profile Table**
Already defined, stores additional information related to the user.

```python
class Profile(Base):
    __tablename__ = "profiles"

    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, autoincrement=True)
    user_id = Column(CHAR(36), ForeignKey('users.id'), nullable=False)
    given_name = Column(String(100), nullable=False)
    family_name = Column(String(100), nullable=False)
    nick_name = Column(String(100), nullable=True)
    picture = Column(String(255), nullable=True)
    updated_at = Column(DateTime, default=func.now(), onupdate=func.now())
    email = Column(String(255), unique=True, nullable=False)
    sub = Column(String(255), nullable=False)

    user = relationship("User", back_populates="profile")

    def __repr__(self):
        return f"<Profile(id={self.id}, user_id={self.user_id}, email={self.email})>"
```

#### 3. **Role Table**
Defines different roles that users can have. This is where you define roles like `admin`, `staff`, `customer`, `artist`, etc.

```python
class Role(Base):
    __tablename__ = "roles"

    id = Column(CHAR(36), primary_key=True, default=lambda: str(uuid4()))
    name = Column(String(50), unique=True, nullable=False)  # E.g., admin, staff, customer, artist
    description = Column(String(255), nullable=True)  # Description of the role

    user_roles = relationship("UserRole", back_populates="role")
    role_permissions = relationship("RolePermission", back_populates="role")

    def __repr__(self):
        return f"<Role(id={self.id}, name={self.name})>"
```

#### 4. **Permission Table**
Defines specific actions that can be taken, e.g., `create_event`, `bid_item`, `delete_user`.

```python
class Permission(Base):
    __tablename__ = "permissions"

    id = Column(CHAR(36), primary_key=True, default=lambda: str(uuid4()))
    name = Column(String(50), unique=True, nullable=False)  # E.g., create_event, bid_item, delete_user
    description = Column(String(255), nullable=True)  # Description of the permission

    role_permissions = relationship("RolePermission", back_populates="permission")

    def __repr__(self):
        return f"<Permission(id={self.id}, name={self.name})>"
```

#### 5. **UserRole Table**
Associates users with roles, allowing a user to have multiple roles.

```python
class UserRole(Base):
    __tablename__ = "user_roles"

    id = Column(CHAR(36), primary_key=True, default=lambda: str(uuid4()))
    user_id = Column(CHAR(36), ForeignKey('users.id'))
    role_id = Column(CHAR(36), ForeignKey('roles.id'))

    user = relationship("User", back_populates="user_roles")
    role = relationship("Role", back_populates="user_roles")

    def __repr__(self):
        return f"<UserRole(user_id={self.user_id}, role_id={self.role_id})>"
```

#### 6. **RolePermission Table**
Associates roles with permissions, defining what actions each role can perform.

```python
class RolePermission(Base):
    __tablename__ = "role_permissions"

    id = Column(CHAR(36), primary_key=True, default=lambda: str(uuid4()))
    role_id = Column(CHAR(36), ForeignKey('roles.id'))
    permission_id = Column(CHAR(36), ForeignKey('permissions.id'))

    role = relationship("Role", back_populates="role_permissions")
    permission = relationship("Permission", back_populates="role_permissions")

    def __repr__(self):
        return f"<RolePermission(role_id={self.role_id}, permission_id={self.permission_id})>"
```

### Implementation Plan

1. **Define Roles and Permissions**:
   - List down all possible roles for both ecommerce and auction systems.
   - Define the permissions associated with each role. For instance, `admin` might have `create_user`, `delete_user`, `view_reports` permissions.

2. **Populate Roles and Permissions Tables**:
   - Populate these tables during system initialization or via an admin interface.

3. **Assign Roles to Users**:
   - When a user is created, assign them roles based on their intended functionality. For example, new users in an ecommerce context might start with the `customer` role.

4. **Access Control Middleware**:
   - Implement middleware in FastAPI to check a user's roles and permissions before granting access to specific endpoints. This can be done using dependency injection with custom dependencies that check user roles and permissions.

5. **UI/UX Considerations**:
   - Provide a clear interface for admins to assign roles and permissions.
   - Offer users the ability to view their roles and permissions.

### Example Workflow

1. **User Registration**:
   - A new user registers, and the default role is assigned (`customer` for ecommerce or `user` for auction).

2. **Role Assignment**:
   - An admin assigns the `artist` role to a user in the auction system, allowing them to create auction events and items.

3. **Permission Check**:
   - When the artist tries to create an auction event, the system checks if the user has the `create_event` permission through the `artist` role.

4. **Dynamic Role Management**:
   - Admins can dynamically change roles and permissions, adding flexibility to manage users across different projects.

### Considerations

- **Scalability**: Ensure that the IAM system can scale with the number of users and roles.
- **Security**: Use JWT or OAuth2 for secure authentication. Regularly audit roles and permissions to avoid privilege escalation.
- **Flexibility**: Design the system to allow easy addition of new roles and permissions without major code changes.

This pattern provides a robust and scalable IAM system that can be extended to various projects with different role and permission requirements.

Adding a **Groups** feature to your IAM (Identity and Access Management) system is an excellent way to simplify permissions management and make it more scalable. Groups allow you to organize users who share similar roles and permissions, making it easier to manage access control collectively. Here's how to integrate groups into your existing IAM architecture:

### Key Concepts for Groups

1. **Groups**: Collections of users. Each group can have specific roles and permissions.
2. **Group Membership**: Defines which users belong to which groups.
3. **Group Roles**: Roles associated with a group that applies to all its members.
4. **Group Permissions**: Permissions directly associated with a group, rather than with individual users.

### Updated Data Structures

#### 1. **Group Table**
Defines different groups, such as `admin_group`, `artist_group`, `user_group`, etc.

```python
from sqlalchemy import Column, String, Text, CHAR
from sqlalchemy.orm import relationship
from uuid import uuid4
from app.database.session import Base

class Group(Base):
    __tablename__ = "groups"

    id = Column(CHAR(36), primary_key=True, default=lambda: str(uuid4()))
    name = Column(String(50), unique=True, nullable=False)  # E.g., admin_group, artist_group, user_group
    description = Column(Text, nullable=True)  # Description of the group

    group_roles = relationship("GroupRole", back_populates="group")
    group_users = relationship("GroupUser", back_populates="group")

    def __repr__(self):
        return f"<Group(id={self.id}, name={self.name})>"
```

#### 2. **GroupUser Table**
Associates users with groups, similar to how roles are associated with users.

```python
from sqlalchemy import Column, ForeignKey, CHAR
from sqlalchemy.orm import relationship

class GroupUser(Base):
    __tablename__ = "group_users"

    id = Column(CHAR(36), primary_key=True, default=lambda: str(uuid4()))
    user_id = Column(CHAR(36), ForeignKey('users.id'))
    group_id = Column(CHAR(36), ForeignKey('groups.id'))

    user = relationship("User", back_populates="user_groups")
    group = relationship("Group", back_populates="group_users")

    def __repr__(self):
        return f"<GroupUser(user_id={self.user_id}, group_id={self.group_id})>"
```

#### 3. **GroupRole Table**
Associates roles with groups. Users in a group automatically inherit these roles.

```python
from sqlalchemy import Column, ForeignKey, CHAR
from sqlalchemy.orm import relationship

class GroupRole(Base):
    __tablename__ = "group_roles"

    id = Column(CHAR(36), primary_key=True, default=lambda: str(uuid4()))
    group_id = Column(CHAR(36), ForeignKey('groups.id'))
    role_id = Column(CHAR(36), ForeignKey('roles.id'))

    group = relationship("Group", back_populates="group_roles")
    role = relationship("Role", back_populates="role_groups")

    def __repr__(self):
        return f"<GroupRole(group_id={self.group_id}, role_id={self.role_id})>"
```

### Updates to Existing Tables

#### **User Table Update**

Add a relationship to `GroupUser`:

```python
class User(Base):
    # Existing fields...

    user_groups = relationship("GroupUser", back_populates="user")
    user_roles = relationship("UserRole", back_populates="user")
    
    # Rest of the User class...
```

#### **Role Table Update**

Add a relationship to `GroupRole`:

```python
class Role(Base):
    # Existing fields...

    role_groups = relationship("GroupRole", back_populates="role")
    user_roles = relationship("UserRole", back_populates="role")

    # Rest of the Role class...
```

### How Groups Simplify Management

1. **Centralized Control**: By managing access at the group level, you reduce the overhead of assigning individual permissions to users. For example, adding a user to the `artist_group` will automatically grant them the roles and permissions associated with artists.

2. **Hierarchy and Inheritance**: If a user belongs to multiple groups, they can inherit roles and permissions from all groups. This approach can cater to complex organizational structures.

3. **Scalability**: Groups are scalable, meaning new roles or permissions can be added to a group, and all users in that group will inherit the changes.

4. **Consistency**: Ensures that all users in a group have consistent access levels, reducing errors and misconfigurations.

### Implementation Workflow

1. **Define Groups and Roles**:
   - Start by defining common groups (e.g., `admin_group`, `artist_group`, `user_group`) and their associated roles and permissions.

2. **Assign Users to Groups**:
   - When a user is created or their role changes, assign them to appropriate groups. For example, an artist user would be added to the `artist_group`.

3. **Access Control Checks**:
   - Modify your access control middleware to check not only the user's direct roles and permissions but also the roles and permissions inherited from groups.

4. **Management Interface**:
   - Create an admin interface for managing groups, roles, and user memberships. This interface will allow admins to easily assign or revoke access.

### Example Use Case Scenarios

1. **Ecommerce System**:
   - **Groups**: `admin_group`, `staff_group`, `customer_group`
   - **Roles**:
     - `admin`: Can manage everything.
     - `staff`: Can manage orders and products.
     - `customer`: Can browse and purchase products.

   - **Workflow**: A user is registered and added to `customer_group`. They inherit `browse_products` and `purchase` permissions. If promoted to staff, they are added to `staff_group`, gaining additional permissions to manage orders.

2. **Art Auction System**:
   - **Groups**: `admin_group`, `staff_group`, `artist_group`, `user_group`
   - **Roles**:
     - `admin`: Can manage everything.
     - `staff`: Can moderate events.
     - `artist`: Can create and manage auction events and items.
     - `user`: Can browse events, bid, and purchase.

   - **Workflow**: An artist joins the platform, added to `artist_group`. They inherit permissions to create events and auction items. A user, part of `user_group`, can bid on items but cannot create events.

### Conclusion

By integrating groups into your IAM system, you achieve a more organized, scalable, and maintainable solution for managing roles and permissions. This approach ensures that as your applications grow in complexity and user base, you can maintain security and access control efficiently.

## IAM MANAGEMENT - RBAC API IMPLEMENTATION

To implement role-based access control (RBAC) in your FastAPI application, you should create a reusable service for checking user roles and permissions. This service will be used in different API endpoints to ensure that only users with the appropriate roles can access certain functionalities.

### Steps to Implement Role Validation:

1. **Define Roles and Permissions**: Clearly define which roles have access to which permissions. You've already outlined roles like `admin`, `staff`, `user`, etc., and their associated permissions. This can be stored in a database or a configuration file.

2. **Create a Role Validation Service**: Implement a service that checks if a user has the required role or permission to access a particular endpoint.

3. **Apply Role Validation in Endpoints**: Use dependency injection to apply role validation in your API endpoints.

### Example Implementation

#### Step 1: Define Roles and Permissions

You can use a simple dictionary to map roles to permissions for this example. For a more scalable solution, consider storing this in your database.

```python
# ./app/auth/permissions.py

ROLES_PERMISSIONS = {
    "admin": ["manage_users", "manage_roles", "manage_groups", "full_access"],
    "staff": ["view_reports", "manage_products", "moderate_content"],
    "user": ["view_auctions", "bid_on_auctions", "purchase_items"],
    "customer": ["view_products", "add_to_cart", "purchase_items"],
    "auction_user": ["view_auctions", "bid_on_auctions"],
    "auction_artist": ["create_auction_event", "manage_own_auctions"]
}
```

#### Step 2: Create Role Validation Service

Implement a reusable service to check if the current user has the required role or permission.

```python
# ./app/auth/role_validator.py

from fastapi import Depends, HTTPException, status
from sqlalchemy.orm import Session
from app.database.session import get_db
from app.auth.auth import oauth_authenticate_current_user
from app.auth.permissions import ROLES_PERMISSIONS

def check_role_permission(required_permission: str, current_user: dict = Depends(oauth_authenticate_current_user), db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
    user_role = current_user.get("role")
    if not user_role:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=403, detail="Role information not found")
    
    user_permissions = ROLES_PERMISSIONS.get(user_role, [])
    if required_permission not in user_permissions:
        raise HTTPException(
            status_code=status.HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN,
            detail="You do not have permission to perform this action"
        )
```

#### Step 3: Apply Role Validation in Endpoints

Use the role validation service in your endpoints by injecting it using FastAPI's dependency injection system.

```python
# ./app/routes/users.py

from fastapi import APIRouter, Depends, HTTPException
from sqlalchemy.orm import Session
from app.database.session import get_db
from app.services.user_service import (
    create_user_service,
    get_all_users_service,
    get_user_by_id_service,
    update_user_service,
    delete_user_service,
    get_user_by_username_service,
    get_user_by_email_service
)
from app.models.user_api_model import UserCreate, User, UserUpdate, UserDeleteResponse, UserSearchRequest
from app.auth.auth import oauth_authenticate_current_user
from app.auth.role_validator import check_role_permission

router = APIRouter()

@router.post("/", response_model=User)
def create_user(user_create: UserCreate, db: Session = Depends(get_db), current_user: dict = Depends(oauth_authenticate_current_user)):
    check_role_permission("manage_users", current_user=current_user)  # Only users with "manage_users" permission can create users
    try:
        return create_user_service(db, user_create)
    except ValueError as e:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=400, detail=str(e))

@router.get("/", response_model=list[User])
def get_users(db: Session = Depends(get_db), current_user: dict = Depends(oauth_authenticate_current_user)):
    check_role_permission("view_reports", current_user=current_user)  # Example permission check
    return get_all_users_service(db)

@router.get("/{user_id}", response_model=User)
def get_user_by_id(user_id: str, db: Session = Depends(get_db), current_user: dict = Depends(oauth_authenticate_current_user)):
    check_role_permission("view_reports", current_user=current_user)
    user = get_user_by_id_service(db, user_id)
    if not user:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail="User not found")
    return user

@router.put("/{user_id}", response_model=User)
def update_user(user_id: str, user_update: UserUpdate, db: Session = Depends(get_db), current_user: dict = Depends(oauth_authenticate_current_user)):
    check_role_permission("manage_users", current_user=current_user)
    try:
        return update_user_service(db, user_id, user_update)
    except ValueError as e:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=400, detail=str(e))

@router.delete("/{user_id}", response_model=UserDeleteResponse)
def delete_user(user_id: str, db: Session = Depends(get_db), current_user: dict = Depends(oauth_authenticate_current_user)):
    check_role_permission("manage_users", current_user=current_user)
    if delete_user_service(db, user_id):
        return {"message": f"User with ID {user_id} has been successfully deleted"}
    else:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail="User not found")

@router.post("/search", response_model=User)
def search_user(request: UserSearchRequest, db: Session = Depends(get_db), current_user: dict = Depends(oauth_authenticate_current_user)):
    check_role_permission("view_reports", current_user=current_user)
    user = None
    if request.email:
        user = get_user_by_email_service(db, request.email)
    elif request.username:
        user = get_user_by_username_service(db, request.username)
    if user:
        return user
    raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail="User not found")
```

### Explanation:

1. **Role Permission Service (`check_role_permission`)**: This function checks if the current user's role has the required permission. If not, it raises a `403 Forbidden` error. You can call this function with the required permission for each endpoint.

2. **Dependency Injection**: Use FastAPI's `Depends` to inject the current user and role validation service into your endpoints. This ensures that the role validation check runs before the endpoint's main logic.

3. **Applying Role Validation**: In each route, call `check_role_permission` with the required permission. This pattern ensures consistent and reusable access control logic.

### Suggestions:

- **Centralize Role Management**: Consider storing roles and permissions in the database. This approach will provide more flexibility in managing roles and permissions dynamically.
  
- **Fine-Grained Permissions**: Depending on the requirements, you can implement more granular permissions. For example, different types of users might have varying levels of access to certain endpoints (read, write, delete).

- **Logging and Monitoring**: Add logging to track access attempts, especially for unauthorized access, to improve security and auditability.

- **Unit Tests**: Implement unit tests to verify that only users with the correct roles and permissions can access specific endpoints. This practice ensures that your role validation logic works as expected.

This approach provides a scalable way to manage roles and permissions across your application, making it easy to integrate new roles and permissions as your project evolves.
